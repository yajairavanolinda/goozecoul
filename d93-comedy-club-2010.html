I was surfing around the internet the other day and came across the Quintessential Quintuplets manga, which has an anime currently airing. Its harem comedy humor isn’t really my thing, but I might watch it if it gets an English dub at some point.

As our game is only on Monday, I thought I could kill some time with this thread. While talking about Stephy's debut at Juve, I remembered that Juve randomly ended up signing Bendtner and Traore on loan. So, I thought we can make a thread about Arsenal's random transfers as well as transfer rumours (probably with sources).
