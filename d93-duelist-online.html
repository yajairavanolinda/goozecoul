So I picked up the Japanese version of the new Yugioh game today and I'm enjoying it a lot. I've tried to play online, but I keep getting "no games available". Is the online community non-existent already, has it not been put up yet or am I doing something wrong. Revalidation cannot be started prior to the Notification Date.

Hey everyone, Recently got back into yugioh in the past couple months by playing legacy of the duelist on PS4. It’s a fantastic game and I have beaten all the campaigns and duelist challenges. I still enjoy the game very much and very much want to keep playing. But man, it is hard to find online matches. Most of the time I wait for several minutes to find someone and half the time they immedialty disconnect. I know this game is a few years old but are a lot of people still playing.

With the dawn of the new fancy pants editor, I'm officially replacing the Storyline Resources thread I had posted here two years ago. This is largely going to be the same thread as over on MTGS (https://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/magic-fundamentals/magic-storyline/649232-magic-storyline-resources-the-stories-and-lore-are) thanks to the upgrades to Reddit making it easier for me to keep them both up-to-date in the same way, however the Reddit character count limit.

This is just a quick little announcement to alert the community that something foul is afoot at DN. I noticed it when I logged on just now ant there were 167 duelists online. I played 1.333. matches, then I got kicked. Before that, someone poster this ( screen shot in the public chat. It shows a guy called 'Pelumi Badrew' claiming that he is either denying service to users of or took down the DN servers. I checked it out, and it turns out DN is down for the whole. Does anyone know where i could get MTG Pricedata prior Or what’s the online yugioh game that has allot of users still playing it? I’m trying to try friendlies to see how my decks play. I’m a noob though as I mainly stick to the older cards. I’m trying to learn new cards as they seem to have ridiculous effects.

Undust your PET, grab your chips and log back into the net for LA GEMA'S NetBattle Soulfers , a brand new Mega Man Battle Network 6 online tournament in 2018!! ~ Hello all! I am Pablo from LA GEMA, here to invite you all to our next event at the end of the month, a BN6 tournament! Some people might already know about the competitive netbattling scene, but I wanted to reach out to the homies in this sub in case more people might be interested, with this tournament as a great way to start. As a huge fan of Yu-Gi-Oh (Anime, card game and video games), one of my great frustrations has been the poor quality of most recent Yu-Gi-Oh video games. I've recently been playing a subbed version of Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC V tag force special, and it has to be probably the best Yu-Gi-Oh console game that I have ever played (In competition with Duelists of the Roses for PS2). Which brings me onto my point. ARC V Tag force special was never released out of Japan and had to be fan subbed, despite I mean, there's the secret staples like "Un ending nightmare", "ultra poly" and the Xyz-tcg but anything else? the afordable options are spiral serpent cards and the lyrical rank 1 core, but those dont have me too excited. what are you guys hyped about 
Simple question. Personally I would love to. Even if the graphics were outdated, the plot nonsensical, and the gameplay extremely basic. I would still play as long as the dueling system and cards were up to date. I could see it being a lot of fun. Let's make a change.org page, get a million signatures and send it to Konami. To be fair, this would probably reduce physical card sales, which means it would likely be a paid subscription-based Does it take a long time to find match, are there ways to sort out decks from different generations, and is the meta decent. Duelists Unite is a new community that was created in November 2016 ( and ). There are several players around the world that play Yu-Gi-Oh, but not all of them have the time and money to compete competitively in physical real life tournaments. The goal of Duelists Unite (DU), is to bring online competitive opportunities for all players around the world, to try different formats that weren't available in their local regions and overall. What the title says basically. Seems like they shoved in Legacy of the Duelist to steam because a new Yugioh Online would cost too many resources in Konami's eyes to be profitable. Either way, it's clear that they won't be keeping their original release date of "Yugioh Online (working title)" or whatever for 2016. Shame. Guess I'll just play Legacy I want to have a custom playmat made with the image of the old Military League playmat. Does anyone know who I could get in touch with that may be able to help with something 遊戯王ocgの全カードリストやデッキ集、用語集など。. 《デュアルスパーク/Gemini Spark》 † 速攻魔法 自分フィールド上に表側表示で存在する レベル4のデュアルモンスター1体を.
