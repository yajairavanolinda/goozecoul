And some time ago (maybe month So last night i decided to download Shadow Play. Something that Geforce Experience does that i HATE is "optimize" my games for me.

It's a bit confusing from what I've read. I've read other people having issues with W10 installing old drivers or W10 updates conflicting with Nvidia GeForce Experience updates. Can anyone shed any light? I'm not even sure if I framed this question correctly. The computer will turn on now like normal, but once the windows logo pops up to load, suddenly the screen goes black, and the mouse icon turns into an hourglass icon along with the mouse. Then after a couple minutes, the full black screen will shrink into a small black window on the windows desktop, and then it will disappear. In addition to this, the geforce experience app no longer updates. Whenever I "search for updates" for new drivers, it gives some sort of error or can't find anyway So for a long time, I was having issues with Microsoft's music service called Groove Music. The Windows 10 app is a UWP app and everytime I played a song, it seemed to just freeze for ages and eventually throw an error or crash the app and wouldn't let me reopen the app for another minute or so. This also happened with the UWP Netflix app and the Movies amp TV app. It never happened with Spotify and I assume that's because they use their own DRM, but I'm not sure. I eventually found the cause. I really wanna use an ENB. However, I am using Win 10 (and apparently that doesn't work?) Everytime I've tried before induced crashing. Should I try more or just give up? Help? EDIT: Well okay, thanks everyone. I finally gave in and allowed the most recent Windows 10 update to install. After a night of letting it do so, I come back to boot up CSGO to find it locked at 30fps (and turns off fl.ux for some reason?) None of my settings were changed in game or in driver. This is the point that I found GeForce Experience removed from my PC as well. After browsing forums I find out it's because Microsoft in all their genius decided to force you to use their shitty Xbox DVR software and defaulting to limit. Hello everyone, yesterday I decided to test the Discord app for the first time, setting it up was quite easy and it has been great to chat with friends so far. Upon rebooting this morning however, I suddenly realized that I cannot access GeForce Experience's game overlay anymore - actually none of GeForce Experience's in-game functions seem to work since I've installed Discord and rebooted the system. I've uninstalled Discord and re-installed the GeForce driver + software multiple times withou. Hey guys, So I have been trying to install a graphics driver using nvidia geforce experience, but everytime I try it does stuff for about 10 minutes and then just says: driver installation failed(it is a list of the different drivers and then it says that they all failed.) Anyone know of how to fix this problem, I have searched and haven't found anything. I am on windows 10 with a geforce gtx 760. Thank. Ever since I downloaded the new client it's been incredibly slow. It takes about 5 minutes for it to get to the login page, and another 5 minutes to start scanning for games (which it does by apparently scanning every file on my pc). Is there a fix for this? Also, I want to disable scanning on startup so that I can tell it to only scan my steam folder, which is where all the games I would want it to have access to are located. I'm using windows 10 64-bit. 
I noticed it occasionally on windows 8.1 but now i Upgraded to 10 SO many things have the FPS counter attached to it (usually in an awkward position and not in the corner like it is in games). Has anyone else noticed What's the best one out of the 3? Performance, filesize, quality. I try to open up the updates, but since I upgraded to 10, the program launches but won't open up in any window. I have 2 monitors and have tried only having one or the other plugged in, but I still can't pull it up. Has anyone had this problems or heard of it? Any bit of help would be greatly appreciated. I have tried everything. Clean install, delete it from control panel, try to install an older version etc. But it doesn't launch. It loads for few seconds then it closes/dissappears. It doesn't even show up on the task bar. Any help? EDIT: I have GTX 970. EDIT 2: Control Panel works. 
Hello. When i buy the alpha and install Geforce experience, inside this program i see the driver info, up i had info about Games driver last version (tomb raider, division) and down windows 10 driver (old, june version). From windows system i remove windows 10 driver and when i rebot, from the geforce experience info they disappeared. About the game all work fine.

Hi, ever since I have updated the OS to build 1511, The shadowPlay feature has stopped working. I wonder if anyone has the same challenge. Also, just for the info, I have a clean windows installation and I have reinstalled the geforce experience twice already. I have also tried running the application with admin privileges, to no avail. Any help will be greatly appreciated. It says I have updates, but when I go and click on it the app splash screens comes up and says updating than disappears. It has never worked since upgrading to Windows 10. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the software and still nothing. Any help is appreciated. I heard the new controllers use Bluetooth to pair to the Shield. Does this mean we can use them on non Shield devices? Was looking to use it with my phone
