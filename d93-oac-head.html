Hey Steven, so I can do 2 OACs per arm, and yesterday tried for a max full FL hold but could only hold it for 2 seconds and it was slightly above parallel too - in your experience is there a point at which a certain number of OACs gives a "free" full front lever, or does the carryover for OACs to front lever diminish after a point? Also regarding back lever neck position, should the head be in line with the rest of the body? Right now my head is pointing towards the ground Roving Fallen's Shoes of Fire; Binds when equipped; Cloth. Feet; 31 Armor + 12 Wisdom; Requires level 31; Allowable Class. Hi, guys. I'm training the one arm pull ups for 2 months now and I wanted to share with you something I was able to do recently. I still use the floor a little bit to lift myself up, but I think my strengh and techinique got better.

A lot of people OAC/OAP differently. Here's a great side by side comparison. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeYQGYa0p3I). And here's a collection of some badass OAPers with different techniques (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7u-0DTInjL4). In general, the techniques all vary based on body position relative to the hand. Most focus is paid to the difference between chin-up grip and pull-up grip (and the fairly common, but not really named neutral grip one armed. er… pull-up.)

What's the best training method for multiple reps? I've gone back to pulley assist 12.5lbs 3x3. But that's really inconsistent: sometimes, I can do all 9, sometimes I fail on 2nd set 2nd or 3rd rep. Should I be using more assistance for all of the sets? Or should I increase assist only if I fail? (Dang, the OAC is so inconsistent. Механический царь чудо-скорпионов воды.

Hello ladies and gents, I played OnC for a year and then I quit in 2013 now again I started. I have a 70 Level Sin and I would like to gear up, run some dungeons. It's so confusing that I couldn't find the right way to get Dual Swords and run dungeons for it. Would you guys help me to understand which path is correct and how to gear up? Thanks.

I’d never heard of Alita but saw the trailers on a couple of Engadget articles last year. I thought it looked pretty cool, both trailers ended with Alita either attacking the Centurion sentries or the Motorball competitor and thought it was refreshing to see something different - those two scenes had a distinctly Japanese feel. The way she slides on the ground while slashing with a sword makes me think of something from Final Fantasy. I didn’t think much more about Давным-давно эта сталь упала в Харадон с далеких звезд.

Or have I fallen for the whole broscience thing. TL;DR at the bottom. Learn from my mistakes. Last week, my band packed up to head to LA - we were super excited - had some writing sessions booked, and even more exciting, we were coming into the city for a single release party/showcase. Lots of heavy hitters supposed to be coming in: labels agents etc. On the last night of the drive, we stopped somewhere a few hours outside of LA for cheaper motel, since our buddy's couch wasn't open until the next night. Everyt. This has been the case for a long time, and while I’m not injured, it still worries me. I have a tight upper pec that I feel mostly with: dip work OAC work when that side is the pulling arm german hang work push-up work Cuban rotations with slow eccentrics help a bit but not completely. Any ideas of things to work on that may help this? Especially when I do dips and push-ups I feel the tightness if I don’t load it slowly and correctly. Doesn’t feel great.

I aimed mainly for Division 1 teams, with a slight preference to G5 teams because I like them. Some D2/D3 conferences don't seem to have a schedule released, though this should For some people that are trying to improve as boulderers, but are also quite busy by having small kids and a full-time job, I post some (hopefully) inspirational information of how I struggle to make everything fit in. I have two little (4 and 5 years old) boys. Everything is based around my inclination to boulder as much as I could, so on a normal week, I would go bouldering on Wednesday evening after kids fall asleep, and on Saturday morning, taking one of the boys with me. Both of those. There's relatively little discussion of the form for One Armed Chin/Pull/Neutral/Ring-Up. I'm no expert as I've only ever achieved two of the styles but we can discuss what's been seen. Hopefully this can be a starting point for more discussion about proper form. A lot of these form notes are to make the OA Up achievable; so, this form discussion is as much about making the move "easier" as it is making it "correct." Shared Form Across Styles Dead Hang. Hang comfortably from pulling.

So in OG2, you mention that training for the OAC should be split roughly 50-25-25 across eccentrics, weighted and assisted concentrics. My question is, if I can not yet do a full eccentric unassisted, but I can do it with a weighted assist of 10kg on a pulley, should I be incorporating eccentrics? Currently I'm performing 3x5 Pulley-Assist OAC (15KG) 3x5 Weighted Chinups (20KG) 3x5 Pulley-Assist OAC (15KG) I'm wondering whether it would be worth it to swap out one of the session. After suffering a series of muscle pulls and elbow pain, I decided to switch my OAC work to gymnastic rings (well one ring specifically.) Here's my new setup: https://imgur.com/VHA7PA1 WHY THE HELL DIDN'T I DO THIS BEFORE? The biggest change is that the the twist is much more manageable. On a normal OAC, I can control my twist but with a counterweight the rope wants to pull me to twist away from my pulling arm. But with a free spinning ring, I can twist the ring into the most comfortable.
