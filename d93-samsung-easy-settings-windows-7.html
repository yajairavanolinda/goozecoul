I just got done replacing the stock Thermal Paste on my Razer Blade Advanced with Liquid Metal. My CPU was thermal throttling in almost every game, and LM help with my Alienware 15R3's thermal problem so I figured I would try on my Blade. I also replaced the stock 512gb NVME with a Samsung 1tb PM961 and applied a thermal pad.

Well fret not as there is an easy method to get updates as soon as they are available. No need to wipe data, have carrier bloatware, tethering limitations, doesnt matter which carrier you already use, and keep receiving OTA updates. What we will do use the is use the Sprint's unlocked firmware variant (which is almost always the first to get the updates) to update the generic unlocked firmware (which I recently made the switch to a S10e from an old S4. By and large, I love the new phone, but in my week or so with the phone I've definitely put a mental list together of things that aren't as good on the modern device than the older one. The lack of indicating light is tough to adjust to, and a lot of the Samsung bloatware (that I grew accustomed to on the S4) isn't as inviting as before. Software follows trends, for better or worse, and I get that. One software change that really is irking. Hi All, This is my 4 Hackintosh in the last 6 months with mixed results, im using a Asus z370 prime A at work for 2 other machines and had 0 issues, everything works so easily so i decided to convert my PC at the time which was an X99 over. This was more problematic and kept freezing under heavy load only in OSX so i just sold that MB/CPU combo and bought a Gigabyte z390 Ultra and a I7 9700k. I was going to by the z370 even though its old because i know how easy and stable it is, but my suppl.

Hi there, I have had the Paperlike HD-F since Tuesday 23 April. I have not had it for long but I have been using it every day as my primary monitor. I will certainly write another review in a couple of months. I have never written a review before, nor am I very technically minded, I do have a few questions at the end about optimizing this device which I would be grateful if anyone here is able to answer. The manual that was sent with the device was in Chinese and I only read English. So I guess here is a photo: (sorry I’m terrible at these) https://i.imgur.com/IDRPLV5.jpg Edit: of note I got the monitor model wrong. It actually is an LG 27M59G-P. It works very well due a few disabilities and limitations I have. It has a “red crosshair in the center of the screen” for gaming that allows me to quickly refocus and find where I was aiming. Edit 2: Remember: CPU is a placeholder until 3000-series Ryzen, but in its own right it holds its own with what I play; much bette. I thought it would be helpful to make a single post aggregating all the common complaints people have with the 9.0 Pie update and how to fix them. This guide is aimed to be new-user friendly.

I just finished my build which I really, really like but I'm having a few issues I'll list below, if anyone can help me I would be greatly appreciative and I would find a way to compensate you for your help.

PCPartPicker part list (https://pcpartpicker.com/list/YrQGQZ) / Price breakdown by merchant (https://pcpartpicker.com/list/YrQGQZ/by_merchant/) Hey all wanted to know if anyone else has gone through the same experience I have. I've got a Note 8 and its great. Its fast, responsive and does anything and everything I ask of it without breaking a sweat. They only problem is that after 6 months of giving it a shot, I still hate it. Unfortunately its a bunch of small simple things that ruin the experience for me. The problems are entirely minor and subjective but I find that the size and shape of the thing makes. Hey Everyone, So this is my first post on reddit and first post on this subreddit.

I will be setting up my private office soon for work in Foreign Exchange trading and really need a good setup that will help me have a 2 x 2 quad display to have charts on 3 screens and use 1 panel as a trade execution monitor. Hey everyone! Watch the "2019 Update" launch trailer (https://youtu.be/3oNHkUUHMdw) on YouTube! We've spent the past year working on a massive new update for Bigscreen with real-time raytracing lighting effects, new environments, new avatars, new VR UI, a Windows audio driver , and more. This update fixes many of the biggest bugs/problems you've had, and adds features you've been asking for. # Summary: Raytraced real-time screen lighting. Light from the big screen shines. I just got my hands on 2 Intel 660p 2TB NVMe drives, and I'd like to use them to replace by big hard drive. I already had a Samsung 960 EVO 500GB that I used for my system and a few other things, and I'd like to keep it this way. I'd like to use the 2 intel SSDs in a RAID 0 array, but I don't know if this is the best thing to do for my needs. First, let me explain why I want to do this. Then, maybe you'll tell me that't not how things work or that there is a better way to achieve my goals. Hi All I've been trying to overclock my core i9 9900k for two weeks now, but i am more and more leaning towards that I just simply got a very bad luck on the silicon lottery. I'm running this in an MSI Z390 Godlike MB, 16 GB 3600 DDR4 and a samsung 970Pro M.2 SSD + AX1000 Corsair PSU, so power should not be an issue. The system runs perfectly at core speeds, no problem. I've followed MSI's guides both from YouTube and their forum to overclock the CPU but I am running into issues. Hi everyone!
